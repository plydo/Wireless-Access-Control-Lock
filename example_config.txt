# example_config.txt - examples and explanations of the configuration file format

# The config file format is similar to the "ini" and "yaml" formats. It consists
# of a single line with the setting's name first, the setting's value second, and
# a separator character in between. The separator character is either '=' (preferred)
# or ':'. The list of settings is unordered and non-hierarchical (no section
# headings). Though unordered, later settings override earlier settings.
# Whitespace is ignored if it is before the name, after the value, in front of the
# separator, or immediately after the separator. Comments begin with '#' (preferred)
# or ';'. Comments may be used on their own line or at the end of a line containing
a setting. For the setting's name, uppercase and lowercase A-Z are treated the same.
# In addition, names may have '-' (preferred) or '_' in them -- these are ignored.

# File Format Examples... (the first line is the canonical/preferred format):
  log-level = 1 # The format in this line is preferred
  Log_level : 1 ; another comment
  LogLevel  = 1
  loglevel:1
  setting-str = Single or double quotes for strings are also OK # comment

# Settings
# Default settings are 0 for number and null for strings unless specified otherwise below
